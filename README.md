## Setup
If Node.js is not already installed on your machine, you can use [this guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to install

Clone this repo to your desktop and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Usage
After you clone this repo to your desktop and install all the dependencies, you can run `npm run server` from the command line to run the server locally on port 5000. After running the server you can test the API endpoints using an API development platform like Postman.

If Postman is not installed on your machine, you can download [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
